# Summary

Our vet told me that cat's watering place should be high enough. I desided to solve this problem by 3d-printing. I wanted the bowl to be not just useful, but be epic and incredible! And when I've seen boldmachines's Medieval Castle, it turnd out exatly what I've needed!
I decided to buy an ordinary plastic bowl and insert it into the castle.
Some parts were cut off, some were rebuilded. The result is what you see.

Though it was designed for a big cat, a little one liked it too.

"Bowl" files - 3d-model of the one I've bought to insert.
